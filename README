ServiceProxy

ServiceProxy is a lightweight SOAP library for Ruby. 

HOW IT WORKS

Loading the library:

require 'rubygems'
require 'service_proxy/base'

GENERATING A PROXY

ServiceProxy comes with a simple generator to get started. It can be invoked
as follows:

wsdl2proxy [wsdl]

This will generate a file named default.rb, in the current directory. The class
will be named GeneratedService, and will define build and parse methods for all
of the available service methods.

Please refer to the specs for extended usage examples.
