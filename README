ServiceProxy

ServiceProxy is a lightweight SOAP library for Ruby. 

HOW IT WORKS

Loading the library:

require 'rubygems'
require 'service_proxy/base'

WRITING A PROXY BY HAND

Unlike Soap4R, this library takes a very different approach to building 
requests and parsing responses. There is little magic and no code 
generation with this library. 

For each service endpoint you want to connect to, you will need to 
subclass ServiceProxy.

Let's say you want to call the method cool1 on a service:

First, you create a subclass:

class SuperCoolService < ServiceProxy::Base
  
  def build_cool1(options)
    # This will generate a simple SOAP envelope. Using the xml block local, you 
    # can inject XML into the body of the envelope.
    soap_envelope(options) do |xml|
      # your XML here
    end
  end
  
  def parse_cool1(response)
    # The response parameter is a simple Net::HTTP response
    # here, we use Hpricot to parse it, but you could use
    # Nokogiri, REXML, etc
    xml = Hpricot.XML(response.body)
    xml.at("cool1Result").inner_text
  end
end

Next, you can attempt to call the service:

service = SuperCoolService.new(url_to_wsdl)
service.cool1

GENERATING A PROXY

ServiceProxy comes with a simple generator to get started. It can be invoked
as follows:

wsdl2proxy [wsdl]

This will generate a file named default.rb, in the current directory. The class
will be named GeneratedService, and will define build and parse methods for all
of the available service methods.
